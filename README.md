# To-Do List App

A simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, mark, and delete tasks. It also stores tasks locally so that they persist even after the browser is closed.

# Features:

✅Add Tasks: Users can add tasks using the input field and the "Add" button.

✅Mark as Completed: Tasks can be checked off by clicking on them, which strikes through the task and marks it as completed.

✅Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks by clicking the '×' icon next to them.

✅Local Storage: The tasks are stored locally, so the list persists after page reloads or browser restarts.

# Technologies Used:

HTML: Structure of the webpage, including input fields, buttons, and task list.

CSS: Styling of the To-Do List app, creating a clean and modern look.

JavaScript: Logic for adding, marking, and deleting tasks, as well as saving the tasks to local storage.

# How to Use:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in any browser to run the app.

Type a task in the input box and click the "Add" button to add a new task.

Click on any task to mark it as completed, and click on the '×' to delete it.

Your tasks will be saved in local storage, so they'll appear when you reload the page.
